## Instructions

HOW TO PLAY GAME:
 1. Open index.html in your browser and the game will start.
 2. Use the arrow keys to move around the map.
 3. If you can reach the water without a collision with the enemy than you will increment the score. If you do have the misfortune of getting hit by a cockroach than you will lose and the score will be set back to 0 and you will have to start over again.
 4. Have fun!!!!
