HOW TO PLAY GAME:
 1. open index.html in your browser and the game will start.
 2. the score is set to 0. if you can reach the water without a collision with the enemy than you will increment the score. If you do have the misfortune of getting hit by a cockroach than you will lose and the score will be set back to 0 and you will have to start over again.
 3. have fun , the game isnt pretty but it works.
